<h3 id="panel-1-virtual-reality-for-interdisciplinary-applications">Panel 1: Virtual Reality for Interdisciplinary Applications</h3>
<p>Tue, March 20th, 2:00 PM (75 min)</p>

<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
<p>Opportunities for virtual reality research and applications have grown tremendously with the new technologies that have become available at the consumer level. Many disciplines now have the chance to implement virtual reality to address domain-specific problems, but barriers still remain as the potential of virtual reality to non-specialists may not be apparent. This panel gives methods on how to use virtual reality productively in interdisciplinary applications. The panelists will present and discuss their experiences on methods for forging interdisciplinary applications in research and education that lead to innovation in both the area of virtual reality and in other disciplines. Interdisciplinary collaborations draw on the different expertise and strengths of multiple investigators that provide an informed and principled way of addressing innovative problems. Interdisciplinary applications involving virtual reality have high potential for supporting research that translates to solving real-world problems addressing clinical populations—such as anxiety disorders and autism—as well as those that address technology-driven societal challenges such as spatial navigation, social interaction, decision making, and communication with media. This panel will feature researchers who have extensive experience in many of these areas of interdisciplinary application. 
The panel will begin with speakers providing a short (5 minutes or less) statement on their approach to interdisciplinary application, and an introduction of both the challenges faced and opportunities afforded. The goal will be to take a forward-looking position and to engage the audience in an active dialog about new directions and possibilities for VR applications that are informed by bringing together researchers and educators from the sciences, humanities, and engineering. The panel will focus on such questions as: how do you find and foster (“jumpstart”) interdisciplinary collaborations? How do you navigate the issues associated with every discipline having a different jargon? Can you come up with effective plans for achieving publications in each discipline? When do you say “no”, that is, how do you avoid becoming an academic VR studio-for-hire?</p>

Dr. Creem-Regehr is a Professor of Psychology at the University of Utah. Her research interests are in space perception and spatial cognition in real and virtual environments, with an emphasis on underlying mechanisms relating to action and body- based perception. Her work studies how perceptual theory and applications relating to virtual environments have mutually informed an understanding of large-scale space perception. Her research has included the influence of selfavatars on perception and action, visual-motor recalibration, spatial perspective taking, and navigation.</p>

  <li><a href="mailto:bobby.bodenheimer@vanderbilt.edu">Bobby Bodenheimer</a>, Ph.D.<br />
Vanderbilt University<br />
Dr. Bodenheimer is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Vanderbilt University. His current research is in the area of virtual reality, specifically how people learn and interact in virtual spaces. This work involves approaching fundamental questions about perception and action in the context of immersive virtual environments and the technologies that build them. Pursuing these questions leads to technological innovation in the design of virtual systems. His recent work using commodity level head-mounted displays involves questions of self-avatars, affordances, and distance perception.</li>
  <li><a href="mailto:jeanine.stefanucci@psych.utah.edu">Jeanine Stefanucci</a>, Ph.D.<br />
University of Utah<br />
Dr. Stefanucci is an Associate Professor in the Psychology Department at the University of Utah. Her research focuses on better understanding if a person’s bodily states, whether emotional, physiological, or physical, affects their spatial perception and cognition. She conducts this research in natural settings (outdoor or indoor), and in virtual environments. This work is inherently interdisciplinary given it spans research on emotion, health, spatial perception and spatial cognition. She has also co-authored the book Visual Perception from a Computer Graphics Perspective with psychology and computer science colleagues.</li>
  <li><a href="mailto:ber1@sfu.ca">Bernhard Riecke</a>, Ph.D.<br />
Simon Frasier University<br />
Dr. Riecke is a psycho-physicist and Cognitive Scientist who’s excited about studying how humans orient in virtual and real environments. His research approach combines fundamental scientific research with an applied perspective of improving human-computer interaction. In particular, he combines multi-disciplinary research approaches and immersive virtual environments to investigate what constitutes effective, robust, embodied and intuitive human spatial cognition, orientation and behavior. This fundamental knowledge is used to guide the design of novel, more effective human-computer interfaces and interaction paradigms that enable similar processes in computer-mediated environments like virtual reality (VR) and multi-media. These improved interfaces can then enable and inspire further research, both fundamental and applied.</li>

University College London<br />
Dr. Hamilton is a Senior Lecturer and leader of the Social Neuroscience group at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience (UCL). Prior to that, she completed a PhD on the impact of neuronal noise for the optimal control of human arm movements (UCL), and postdoctoral work on imitation in autism and brain systems for action understanding. She was a lecturer at the University of Nottingham until 2013, and was awarded the Experimental Psychology Society prize lectureship for 2013. Her current research interests include how and why people imitate each other, how social skills differ in autism, and the neural mechanisms of social interaction.</li>

<h3 id="panel-2-how-should-social-virtual-reality-work">Panel 2: How should social virtual reality work?</h3>
<p>Wed, March 21st, 11:00 AM (90 min)</p>

<h4 id="overview-1">Overview</h4>
<p>There are now several social applications for immersive virtual reality systems. Recent studies show that users are starting to engage with these systems for more extended periods, and that they are reaching audiences that wouldn’t normally socialise in online games. The applications provide a variety of different ways of engaging with spaces, different tasks to engage with and different representations of humans.
This panel will raise and discuss issues around the future of such systems. How should social mixed reality should be constructed in order to support the types of experience that we want to have. We will bring together platform holders and developers with researchers. We will take an inter-disciplinary look at the issues. This will span:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How broad should tools for avatar customisation be?</li>
  <li>What procedures, tools or governance should support fair and equitable use of these spaces?</li>
  <li>How do we support accessibility across the general population?</li>

<h3 id="panel-3-getting-close-to-domain-users-vr-and-ar-in-support-of-application-domains">Panel 3: Getting close to domain users: VR and AR in support of application domains</h3>
<p>Wed, March 21st, 2:00 PM (75 min)</p>

<h4 id="overview-2">Overview</h4>
<p>The last couple of years have been marked by an explosion of solutions in the VR and AR domains: the accepted norm of this market has been to provide users with lightweight VR and AR displays, input controllers that recognize human gestures, superior tracking solutions, as well as software development environments that enable much faster prototyping and development of high quality applications. Those contemporary commercial off the shelf VR/AR hardware and software solutions are not only affordable to research laboratories, their price also makes them accessible to large number of potential users – having uninterrupted access to inexpensive tools is an important element of the diffusion process and adoption of any innovation.</p>

<p>While VR community witnesses a renewed vigor and a wealth of studies in the domain of basic research, the absence of equally vibrant research in different application domains that most directly benefit users is also evident. This lack of extensive research focused on testing suitability and effectiveness of different VR/AR solutions in application domains inevitably results with a lack of tried and proven standards on how and when to use VR/AR solutions effectively and efficiently in those domains.  The existence of those standards is one of several major elements that masses of users need if they are to change their daily practices and incorporate VR/AR solutions in their work environments. The promise of large scale adoption of VR/AR solutions therefore still remains the promise in many application domains.<br />
We believe this point in time is perfect to start bringing our understandings from basic research and start actively applying them to a diverse set of application domains. The goal of this panel is to raise awareness and bring to the attention of the VR/AR research community the various needs and opportunities for research in different application domains. Below are some of the topics and questions highlighting the issues the researches who work in different application domains need to address:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What may be the reasons for low number of publications that report studies done in specific application domains?</li>
  <li>What type of knowledge, skills and any other investment one needs to make to conduct investigations in given application domain(s)?</li>
  <li>Ups and downs of user studies that involve domain users. Tips and best practices for involving them.</li>
  <li>Experiences with metrics and measurement of the specific application domains.</li>
  <li>Standards of use in application domains (when and how to use VR/AR solutions).</li>
  <li>Taking into consideration things beyond VR/AR hardware and software ((examples: pedagogy, training approaches).</li>
  <li>The role of COTS (commercial off the shelf) solutions in work with domain users?</li>
  <li>Strategies to deploy VR/AR equipment “in the field”.</li>
  <li>Do we have to think about large scale adoption issues when doing research and why?</li>
  <li>Perceived obstacles for large scale adoption of VR/AR solutions in different application domains.</li>
  <li>Future work/frontiers, much-needed work, novel research avenues that address needs of domain users.</li>
  <li>Building lucrative relationships among industry, government and academic representatives. Opportunities for collaboration.</li>
</ul>

<p>This panel brings researchers whose research agenda is firmly based in a variety of application domains: medicine, rehabilitation, sports, education, firefighting and military. The panel will start with each panelist commenting their major research focus and approach while working in different application domains (5 min each). The moderator will then initiate the discussion on different questions with participation from the audience.</p>

<h3 id="panel-4-the-future-impact-of-neuroscience-and-cognitive-psychology-on-virtual-environments">Panel 4: The future impact of neuroscience and cognitive psychology on virtual environments</h3>
<p>Thu, March 22nd, 11:00 (90 min)</p>

<h4 id="overview-3">Overview</h4>
<p>Virtual environments (VEs: Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, and Augmented Virtuality) have benefitted from the fields Neuroscience and Cognitive Psychology. Many VE techniques are based on known findings such as change blindness and the rubber hand illusion. Neuroscience, Cognitive, and Clinical Psychology have also benefits for VE technologies, such as treatments for phobias and pain modification. This panel will explore new VE research directions and potential impacts associated with Neuroscience and Cognitive Psychology.</p>

<p>The rapid advancement of sensing technologies (such as electroencephalography (EEG), near field infrared brain scan (fNIRS), positron emission tomography (PET) and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) have created new opportunities to better understand brain/behaviour relationships using VEs. We are now able to gain a better understanding of the impact of VEs on learning, training, supporting industrial tasks, and long-term usage. VE technology is now entering a phase of being a consumer/commodity product. The panel with explore how the wide spread usage of VEs effect their usage for treatments in the Neuroscience and Cognitive Psychology domain. The current authoring tools are lowering the barrier of entry into the development of virtual worlds.</p>

<p>The panel with explore the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How do VEs effect the human brain and behavior?</li>
  <li>What are some related potentially high impact applications of VEs?</li>
  <li>How will this lower barrier of entry impact Neuroscience and Cognitive Psychology research?</li>
  <li>What new directions in these areas can be supported in the future?</li>
